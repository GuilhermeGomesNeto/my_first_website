# Joca Games

Hey there!

The 1st version of this project was the first website I've made while I was still learning the basics of HTML and CSS.

As I was coding lots of simple games when first learning JavaScript, I had the idea of making a website for a fake game company inspired by my dog to practice my HTML and CSS skills.
  
I've worked a bit on the project though, with the intention to modernize the site, improve the design and make it more responsive.
