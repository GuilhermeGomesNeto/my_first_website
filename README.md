# Gaming Company Website

Hey there!

This project is the first website I've made while I was still learning the basics of HTML and CSS.

When first learning how to code, I made lots of simple games (like Freeway, Pong etc). So when I started learning HTML and CSS, I had the idea of making a website for a fake game company inspired by my dog to practice what I was learning so the site is very simple.
  
I've worked a bit on the project recently but haven't made any big changes yet, just made the design a little more responsive, changed some colors and started positioning everything with flexbox.
